# chainlink

Chainlink is an extensible python link handler for designing custom link handlers 
based on a wide range of matching criteria.

This is highly conceptual right now, and should be usable soon.

The idea here is to make a way to handle links on more than a protocol basis
and have different handlers for links matching different criteria.

Hopefully with some help, we can build something robust enough to be included
in a proxy that can handle links WITHIN a browser even, and be integrated into
Desktop Environments complete with GUI config tools.

Using this as a link handler would also be able to create link history logs and
favorites systems OUTSIDE a browser that can be managed using various cli or gui
tools.

I originally started this because first and foremost I HATE modern browsers and
how ugly the WWW has become, and two things in particular I dealt with on a daily
basis in IRC were links to news sites and youtube videos.. and if you're still
reading this, chances are I don't have to tell you how aweful these two kinds
of sites can be.

I will post the APOC code just to show you how aweful my original 45min hack was,
though THAT code actually works, its just too atrocious to expand upon.

I am well beyond my scope, as you see my APOC code, that's my typical way of doing
things for my own purposes.. this coding in the public domain where things will
be used and reviewed and altered by other people is something I have little to no
experience in. 

I also feel the name could use a changing, this was the best I came up with at the
time. Feel free to dive in and straighten any of these issues out if you have the
interest or ability to do so.
